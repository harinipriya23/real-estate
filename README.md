# 🏠 Real Estate Application ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18-red) ![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/TailwindCSS-3.0-blue)

> I built this advanced, fully responsive real estate application using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to let users explore luxury homes for rent or sale, with powerful filters for property type, price, and location.

Under the hood, I've implemented dynamic routing with react-router-dom and used a combination of useReducer, useState, and useEffect for state management. I also leveraged React Context to handle global state across the components.

The app is great for showing off modern frontend development skills because it's built on a real-world platform concept, giving it a professional feel. And thanks to Vite, the development experience was top-notch, with super fast, optimized production builds."
